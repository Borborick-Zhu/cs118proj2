The Prostitute – Chapter 26
(A fanfiction from the perspective of Eet)
Seeing my mom cry like that, my only response was crying even harder. Unable to breathe between each wail that I let out, I grasped onto her frail body with my long but chubby arms. My father tightly gripped onto my hands on the way back – afraid that I would run away. His other arm slightly hovering over my new mother, almost assuring that everything would be okay. She smiled at me plainly with a slight hostility. I was not her daughter, and she was not my mother. That fact could never be changed.
Father’s house was nothing special. A humble abode that consisted of a wooden foundation, straw walls, and wooden furniture. With a little bit of scrutiny, you could spot the grease stains amongst the walls, the little splinters hidden along the dinner table, and the colonies of mold gradually accumulating along the bedside. Along the entrance was a wooden carved tiger figure, a guardian they called it. Father told me that it guards against evil spirits. I thought it was quite cute.
One rule to remember in this household was that no matter what happened, I am not mother’s daughter. I had no blood relation, and I had no business being there. It just happened to occur that she was nice enough to accept Father’s mistake. That mistake being me. She never verbally said anything – but actions always speak louder than words. As a toddler, my bed, my food, my temper, and eventually my periods were all my father’s responsibility. I remember the days when father would come home with battered eyes and proceed to recite the same bedtime story every night. Some nights, he would recite them with his eyes closed – his words slurring. I would fall asleep to the wafts of his rancid sweat, under the light of the night lamp, falling deeper with each verse.
Over the years, the argument over my responsibilities and my future left a lingering heaviness in our home. Mother always initiated the arguments. Nothing in particular was wrong. I was just wrong. When you dislike someone, there is always something you can point out – something that pisses you off. I felt like an intruder, a cause of discord. At some point, her annoyances were justified. I would actively misplace her belongings, even tamper with her clothing just so I could shorten her lifespan just by that little bit. The term "Mother" was nothing but a placeholder. I was never her child and never treated as such. It got to a point where even father would come back home, seeing me battered with bruises sitting on the bed and turn away. He had no energy to engage in the conflict between mother and me. Not one day passed without father coming home without reeking of sweat, mud-covered legs, and infested with scratches in places that he wasn’t even aware of. I didn’t want to burden father either – he was the backbone of this family. Without him, I would have nowhere to live.
That isn’t to say that life was boring at any point. In fact, I’d argue that life was the most interesting during my peak conflict with mother. It wasn’t the good kind of interesting though – the kind of interesting where you feel like you have a fist constantly pressing up against your chest. Breathing sometimes got difficult and sleeping became a sport. On unfortunate nights, you would twist and turn around for hours until finally, you fell asleep from the fatigue of finding the most comfortable place to sleep in. I’d wake up, fearing what mother had to say to me – almost peeking out into the main room to check if she’d notice me, and then, after she’d notice me, prepare myself for whatever she had to say to me. I got off on most days but on other days, she’d glare at me and tell me to clean up after myself. I wasn’t inherently unclean. I’d argue that mother was dirtier than me. It’s just that I was Eet, not her daughter.
During that time, I had also found a boy I liked in school. His name was Amree. A cute boy with silky straight black hair, a tall and skinny frame, and very tanned. He had a model-esque face but a stubby nose, that’s what made him cute. He was a boy of very few words, if not none. I could only remember him nodding to what his friends said and kindly smiling. After which, he would go on to finishing his lunch. He’d sit in class with a perfect posture, listening intently, and diligently taking his notes. Yet, he’d never raise his hand to answer questions. A quiet man. That’s what I liked about him, I guess. He gave me a peace of mind – someone I could confide in.

Amree had two other brothers. An older and a younger brother. He was definitely closer to his younger brother as that’s all he was responsible for. He told me that he had an older brother who was around thirty-five who worked on the farmlands. Some kind of tall, strong, brute force brother that was perfect for working in the fields. So he was stuck caring for the little brother Ananda. He was a snotty little boy. He’d go around licking all the furniture and then spread the germs with his supersonic cough that somehow echoed in the farmlands. A devil of a child – the complete opposite of Amree. Then there was his mother, primary caretaker of his family. She was the backbone of the house, a queen bee of sorts. The children’s food, hygiene, education, clothing and even the cleanliness of the house was all her responsibility. The father, as usual, was only responsible for earning money. Their father made enough money that their mother did not have to work. Instead, she stayed home as a house-wife of sorts. Amree didn’t say much about her mother other than that. But that alone told me that he greatly respected his mother. I didn’t tell him much about my family, besides the fact that I had no siblings. I didn’t want to talk about mother. Nor did I want to say that my actual mother passed when I was very young. I just remember that mom’s name was Reun and that when she was alive, I was a child with a home.

Midway through highschool, father said he could no longer sustain my education. I saw this coming. We’d barely make enough money to eat everyday, let alone live a clean and healthy life. Not too long ago, mother had to help father out on the fields. By the time they both got back, she no longer had the energy to pick out my every flaw. For some weeks of winter, we’d go for days without eating, just to eat a big meal every few days. My father slowly withered away just as mother did. I was young so it was okay. I’d help out where I could, as much as a girl could do on the farmlands. But that wasn’t enough. Prices were going up and wages weren’t. It became harder and harder to live. It was at that time that I got in contact with Amree again. He’d grown bigger and stronger, with a lean but wide frame and short stubby hair. Still the same tan skin, chiseled face and thick eyebrows that I knew. Except he was much taller than me now. I met him on my way back from home, and I he had asked me to come over. 

That night I went over, he poured me a cup of tea and sat me down in his main room.

“How’s your family?” he smiled whilst taking a sip of his tea. 

“Not doing too well. They’re barely eating”. 

“I can tell. Are you okay?”

“I’m fine.”

“I missed you in school, you know,” he stared. 

“I missed you too.”

He didn’t say that much after that. Took another sip of his tea and stared into the blank space behind me. He left a long pause before inching closer to me. 

“I want you to… work for me.” 

I stared at him confused.

“How so?”

“It’s not the best line of work, but it pays good. I know your family is struggling right now, so this could help a lot.” He couldn’t look me in the eyes saying that. 

“What’s the job?”

He changed his focus onto me. Both hands wrapped around his tea. 

“Become a prostitute.”
